      Latest version of each order record.
      The model keeps only the most recent state per order_id,
      using load_date as the primary ordering and ingestion_ts as a secondary tie-breaker.
      This layer provides a clean current-state view for downstream marts.

      - name: order_id
        description: Unique identifier of the order representing the current state

      - name: load_date
        description: Batch partition date used as primary ordering to identify the latest record per order
        tests:

      - name: ingestion_ts
        description: Ingestion timestamp used as secondary ordering when multiple records exist for the same load_date
        tests:
